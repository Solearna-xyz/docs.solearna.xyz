# Immutable Certifications

Yet we won't stop just yet.&#x20;

Solearna is an ecosystem that build for education, and at the end, it's the users, the students, who are the primary users that we want to enable and empower, with knowledge and insights. We need the last pieces of puzzles to enable this: certifications that leverage NFT technology.

Immutable certification refers to the creation of tamper-proof and transparent records of certifications and credentials using blockchain technology. By using blockchain, an individual's qualifications can be recorded in an unalterable and secure way, enabling easy verification by employers or other parties without intermediaries. Immutable certification provides individuals with greater control over their credentials, reducing the risk of loss or theft, and increasing the speed and ease of verification processes. This has particular benefits in fields where certification is critical, such as healthcare and finance, and has the potential to transform the way credentials are recorded and verified across various industries.
