## Overview

Solearna is an incentivized educational platform built on Solana that resolves the complex landscapes in education that has been breaking down over the last decade.

Parties within education system are facing multi-dimensional challenges that prevent skill and knowledge empowerment efficient and effectively,

* **Students** can hardly maintain their _<mark style="color:purple;">attention</mark>_&#x20;
* **Educators** are exhausted by demanding _<mark style="color:purple;">burdens</mark>_
* **Parents** don't know how to handle sudden and future _<mark style="color:purple;">challenges</mark>_
* **The Public sector** is running out of _<mark style="color:purple;">resources</mark>_
* **Employers** are not satisfied with traditional _<mark style="color:purple;">trainings</mark>_



There's no easy solution to resolve this given so many moving parts, nor anyone could move the entire system back to its right track by just tackling one or two pillars at a time.

We need to rethink the entire system with all the dynamics rerouted. By leveraging the best experience we have learnt from traditional EdTech and the economic & cultural dynamics invented from Web3, Solearna is hence borned.

In Solearna, we focus in five dimensions to revive the liveliness of EdTech.

* <mark style="color:purple;">**Gamification**</mark> with short exercise cycles to maintain _attention_&#x20;
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Scaling**</mark> resource utilization online to relief _burdens_
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Knowledges**</mark> Graphs aggregate facts and new methods for  _challenges_
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Marketization**</mark> by web3 means to pull in new liquidity and _resources_
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Certification**</mark> online provide renewable _trainings_

And yes, we're building Rome. And our first step is our community.
