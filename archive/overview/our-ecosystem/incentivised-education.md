# Incentivised Education

Fighting for attention has been the battleground among social medias and online entertainments, which certainly has reduced the time and chances that individual might study and grow, limiting the delivery efficiency of education process. As our first pillar, we need to overcome this by introducing rewards, psychologically, socially, and even financially, through gamified vehicles.

In Web2, individual EdTech like Duoligo has proven gamification and achieved millions of users. The glass ceiling they have is lacking social element that enables peers motivation. With fatigue developed over the years as in-game achievement is getting everywhere, a new kind of incentive triggers is necessary, and thereby we introduce the Web3 components, both tokenization of rewards and also borderless Web3 learning communities.
