# Viral Learning Communities

Web3 communities have been developed into a new form of social entity over the last few years. Thanks to the Defi summary and rapid blockchain adoption in reality. Not only we have seen a high stickiness to communities members, but also numerous autonomous activities that driven from the communities that bring engagement and even growth to the projects. We will utitlize our experience in Web3, in particular Solana as first step, to experiment the potential in autonomous  learning communities to complement what most Web2 EdTech fails to provide: the social aspect.&#x20;

The social aspect does not limit to students, but also teachers that provide and share knowledge to those are prepared to learn and grow. Next, we talk about how we might assist them to drive teachership more efficient, and most impostantly, collective in a dencentralized manner.
